## Create chat completion

With the OpenAI block, you can create a chat completion based on your user queries and display the answer back to your typebot.

This integration comes with a convenient message type called **Dialogue**. It allows you to easily pass a sequence of saved assistant / user messages history to OpenAI:

    alt="OpenAI messages sequence"
  />
</Frame>

Then you can give the OpenAI block access to this sequence of messages:

## Ask assistant

This action allows you to talk with your [OpenAI assistant](https://platform.openai.com/assistants). All you have to do is to provide its ID.

## Create speech

This action allows you to transform a text input into an audio URL that you can reuse in your bot.

:::note
The generated audio URLs are temporary and expire after 7 days. If you need to store them, make sure to download them before they expire.

## Using Multiple Open AI Blocks: Tips and Tricks

In this video, I discuss some important things to keep in mind when using multiple Open AI blocks consecutively. I provide an example where we ask the user for a topic, generate a summary, and display a list of authors.

I explain that streaming messages is not possible when they are prefixed or suffixed by text, and that all blocks need to compute before displaying anything.

I also demonstrate how formatting can be affected by the presence of text before a message. Watch this video to learn how to optimize your use of multiple Open AI blocks.

## Troobleshooting

### Error message: "OpenAI block returned error"

It means your OpenAI block is not configured properly. Please check the following:

- You have selected an OpenAI account
- You have at least 1 **user** message or a **Dialogue** message set up.

### It returns an empty message

It most likely mean that you exceeded your OpenAI free quota. Add a payment method to your OpenAI account to continue using it.
