Your typebot flow can be publicly shared. For this, open the Share menu and enable the `Make the flow publicly available` option:

<<<<<<< HEAD:apps/docs/docs/editor/share.md
<img
  src="/img/share.png"
  alt="Share menu"
/>
=======
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/publish.png" alt="Publish menu" />
</Frame>
>>>>>>> upstream/main:apps/docs/editor/publish.mdx

The flow can then be tested by non-authenticated guests. They are able to check all the options and can play the bot in preview mode.
